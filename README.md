# System Architecture for Laravel Application on AWS

---
## Relational Database Server
- **AWS RDS (db.m5.large)**: Use PostgreSQL for its full ACID compliance and high data integrity, suitable for audit trails.
  - **Backup and Recovery**: Enable automated snapshots and point-in-time recovery to ensure data reliability.

## Application Servers
- **Instances**: Start with at least 2 AWS EC2 `t3.medium` instances to handle application workloads. Scale up as needed based on application demand.
  - Use a web server or framework setup, such as **Nginx** or **Apache**, optimized for Laravel.

## Queue Server
- **AWS cache.t3.medium**: For queue implementation, consider:
  - **RabbitMQ**: For advanced message routing.
  - **Redis**: For simpler queueing needs with high throughput.
  - Alternatively, use **AWS SQS** as a fully managed queueing service.
  - **Optional**: Use dedicated in-memory databases like Redis or Memcached for batch processing if required.

## Storage
- **Amazon S3**: Use for log archives to enable cost-effective storage.
  - **Optional**:
    - Use **Amazon Athena** for querying archived logs. Define an appropriate schema for structured or semi-structured data (e.g., JSON).
    - Implement **AWS Lambda** to trigger batch archiving of logs based on time or data thresholds.

---

## Security

### Database
- **Access Control**: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or least-privilege principles based on user roles.
- **Encryption**:
  - Use encryption at rest. For PostgreSQL, utilize the `pgcrypto` extension to encrypt sensitive data columns.
  - **Note**: Encrypting individual columns can impact query performance. Consider **AWS KMS** for full database encryption if performance is critical.
- **Archived Data**:
  - Retain encryption for archived logs but add fields for keyword-based searches. This allows querying with **Amazon Athena** and performing decryption only after retrieving relevant records.

### Application Servers
- **SSL**: Enforce SSL/TLS for all communications.
- **Firewall Rules**: Close unnecessary ports and define explicit rules.
- **VPC**: Place application servers in a private subnet within a VPC.
- **Load Balancer**: Configure security rules, such as IP whitelisting or blocking.
  - **Optional**: Use a NAT Gateway to enable controlled outbound internet access for servers in private subnets.

### Other Services
- **Queue Server and S3**:
  - Use private subnets for services where applicable.
  - For S3, configure **VPC endpoints** to enable private access without exposing traffic to the internet.

---

## Performance

### Database
- **Archiving**:
  - Implement data archiving to S3 to reduce database costs and maintain optimal performance.
  - Use lifecycle policies for archived data, such as automatic tiering to Glacier for long-term cost optimization.

### Application Servers
- **Containerization**:
  - Use **Docker** and **Kubernetes** for containerization and orchestration to enhance scalability and reliability.
  - Specify whether this setup is intended for microservices or hosting monolithic Laravel applications.

### Application Architecture
- **Microservices**:
  - Design the application using REST-based microservices for better modularity and scalability.
- **Laravel Libraries and Extensions**:
  - Leverage third-party libraries to optimize performance and security:
    - **L5 Swagger**: For API endpoint documentation.
    - **Laravel Sentry**: For internal error monitoring.
    - **Spatie Laravel**: For role-based access control of API endpoints.
    - **Laravel Throttle**: To limit API usage and prevent abuse.
    - **Horizon**: For managing Laravel queue workers.
    - **Laravel Passport**: For token-based access control using OAuth2 authentication.
    - **AWS SDK for PHP**: For seamless interaction with AWS services.
  - **Optional**:
    - **Laravel Scheduler**: For automating batch operations, such as archiving logs to S3 or generating periodic reports.

## Crucial Code Snippets

### AuditTrailController
```php
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Queue;

class AuditTrailController extends Controller
{
    public function log(Request $request)
    {
        // Validate the incoming request data
        $validatedData = $request->validate([
            'type' => 'required|string|in:user_action,system_event,custom_event',
            'details' => 'required|array', // Expecting JSON data in 'details'
        ]);

        // Dispatch the data into the appropriate queue
        switch ($validatedData['type']) {
            case 'user_action':
                Queue::push(new \App\Jobs\LogUserAction($validatedData['details']));
                break;

            case 'system_event':
                Queue::push(new \App\Jobs\LogSystemEvent($validatedData['details']));
                break;

            case 'custom_event':
                Queue::push(new \App\Jobs\LogCustomEvent($validatedData['details']));
                break;

            default:
                return response()->json(['error' => 'Invalid event type'], 400);
        }

        // Respond with HTTP 202 Accepted status.
        // Critical code so that api call to audit logger will be non blocking type
        return response()->noContent(202);
    }
}
```

### Route
```php
Route::post('/audit-trail/log', [AuditTrailController::class, 'log']);
```

### Job Class for Logging User Actions
```php
namespace App\Jobs;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Bus\Dispatchable;
use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;

class LogUserAction implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithQueue, Queueable, SerializesModels;

    protected $details;

    /**
     * Create a new job instance.
     *
     * @param array $details
     */
    public function __construct(array $details)
    {
        $this->details = $details;
    }

    /**
     * Execute the job.
     */
    public function handle()
    {
        // Validate required keys in the details array
        if (!isset($this->details['user_id'], $this->details['object_type'], $this->details['object_id'], $this->details['description'])) {
            throw new \Exception('Missing required details for logging user action.');
        }

        // Log user action into the database
        \DB::table('audit_logs')->insert([
            'event_type' => 'user_action',
            'user_id' => $this->details['user_id'],
            'object_type' => $this->details['object_type'],
            'object_id' => $this->details['object_id'],
            'description' => $this->details['description'],
            'metadata' => json_encode($this->details['metadata'] ?? []), // Optional metadata
            'timestamp' => now(),
        ]);
    }
}
```

### Client API Call to Store Audit Trail Logs
```php
$response = $client->post($url, [
    'headers' => [
        'Prefer' => 'respond-async', // Standard header for async requests. Making request a non blocking process
        'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
    ],
    'json' => [
        'type' => $type, // E.g., 'user_action'
        'details' => $details, // E.g., JSON data with event specifics
    ],
    'http_errors' => false, // Prevent exceptions on HTTP errors
]);

if ($response->getStatusCode() !== 202) {
    // Handle error response
    throw new \Exception('Failed to log audit trail: ' . $response->getBody());
}
```
This acts as a guide and needs to be adjusted if caller is front end.

## End-to-End (E2E) Tests for Audit System

### Test Scenarios

#### Log a User Action
- API call to `/audit-trail/log`.
- Verify the log is stored in the `audit_logs` table.

#### View Logs (Optional)
- Query logs using a UI or API endpoint (if available).
- Apply filters and verify results.

#### Archive Logs
- Simulate archiving old logs to S3 and ensure they are no longer in the database but accessible in S3.

---

### Implementation (Example using Cypress)

#### Log a User Action
```javascript
describe('Audit Log API', () => {
    it('logs a user action and verifies database entry', () => {
        cy.request('POST', '/audit-trail/log', {
            type: 'user_action',
            details: {
                user_id: 1,
                object_type: 'Invoice',
                object_id: 123,
                description: 'Created an invoice',
                metadata: { key: 'value' }
            },
        }).then((response) => {
            expect(response.status).to.eq(202);

            // Verify database entry (use a custom command or stubbed DB query)
            cy.task('queryDatabase', 'SELECT * FROM audit_logs WHERE object_id = 123')
              .then((result) => {
                  expect(result).to.have.length(1);
                  expect(result[0].event_type).to.eq('user_action');
              });
        });
    });
});
```

#### View Logs (UI Testing)
```javascript
describe('View Audit Logs', () => {
    it('filters logs by user and verifies results', () => {
        cy.visit('/audit-logs');

        // Apply filter
        cy.get('[data-test="filter-user-id"]').type('1');
        cy.get('[data-test="apply-filter"]').click();

        // Verify displayed logs
        cy.get('[data-test="log-entry"]').should('have.length.at.least', 1);
        cy.get('[data-test="log-entry"]').first().should('contain.text', 'Created an invoice');
    });
});
```

#### Archive Logs
```javascript
describe('Archive Logs', () => {
    it('archives logs older than 1 year and verifies S3 storage', () => {
        cy.task('triggerLambda', { functionName: 'archiveLogs' })
          .then(() => {
              cy.task('queryDatabase', 'SELECT * FROM audit_logs WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL 1 YEAR')
                .then((result) => {
                    expect(result).to.have.length(0); // No old logs in DB

                    // Verify log presence in S3 (using a mocked S3 API)
                    cy.task('checkS3Object', { bucket: 'audit-logs', key: 'archive/2022.json' })
                      .then((exists) => {
                          expect(exists).to.be.true;
                      });
                });
          });
    });
});
```

## Example: Integrate Automated Testing with Terraform

### 1. Use Terraform to Deploy Testing Infrastructure
- Terraform can provision the infrastructure required for your testing environment. For example:
  - Deploy application servers, queue servers (Redis/RabbitMQ), and databases.
  - Configure S3 buckets for storage.
  - Set up testing environments, such as a staging environment for end-to-end (E2E) tests.

### 2. Integrate Terraform with Testing Frameworks
- After deploying infrastructure with Terraform, integrate testing tools (like Cypress, PHPUnit, or Playwright) to validate the audit system.

### 3. Trigger Testing Post Deployment
- Use a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) to run automated tests after Terraform applies the infrastructure.

### 4. Incorporate Terraform Modules for Test-Specific Resources
- You can create Terraform modules dedicated to provisioning resources for testing purposes.

### 5. Use Terraform Outputs to Feed Testing Frameworks
- Terraform outputs can provide dynamic information (e.g., API endpoints, database connection strings) to your testing framework.
- Pass Outputs to Tests: In a CI/CD pipeline, pass these outputs as environment variables to the test framework.

### 6. Validate Infrastructure and Application Together
- Combine infrastructure tests (e.g., Terraform's `terraform plan` checks or AWS resource availability) with application-level automated tests.
- **Application Tests**: Run spec and E2E tests (e.g., PHPUnit, Cypress) after infrastructure validation.
